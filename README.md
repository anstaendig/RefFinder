RefFinder is a user-friendly web-based comprehensive tool developed  for evaluating and screening reference genes from extensive experimental datasets. It integrates the currently available major computational programs (geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ¦¤Ct method) to compare and rank the tested candidate reference genes. Based on the rankings from each program, It assigns an appropriate weight to an individual gene and calculated the geometric mean of their weights for the overall final ranking.

RefFinder is developed by PHP. Users can deploy it to a Php-based server (Apache + PHP) and run it.
